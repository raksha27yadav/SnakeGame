This is a Snake Game entirely made with html,css and javascrpit.

In this game there's food that snake has to eat to increase the score ,also your live score is on the right side at the corner and if the snake bump to itself or to the boundaries game will get over , when you'll press arrowup key snake will go up ,when pressed arrowDown it'll go down, when pressed arrowLeft it'll move to left and when pressed arrowRight it'll move to right.

I have used requestAnimationFrame for fps that helped maintaining the speed of the snake . also i've added some music to give a feel and i've used local storage to reflect the Hiscore and i've used random library of javascrpt to put the food at random locations . I've used grid of css to move the snake according to different keys pressed by user.
